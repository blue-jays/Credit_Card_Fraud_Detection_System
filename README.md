# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_EDA
A repository for my first credit card fraud detection EDA.


## Future Consideration 
### Encoding and dimensionality
- instead of Label encoder, more appropiate encoding technique like one hot encoding will be used
- Will look into the problem if increased dimensionality, and possibly if this split feature can catch the pattern ,feature importance.
- Will also see if they add upto the 'real' importance.
- Will see if the label encoder is really giving us consistent answer or not

### Imbalanced dataset and its effect
- Validate it against  resampling, see if resampling has an effect on the feature importance
- See if the randomforest regressor is biased or not because of this imbalance

### Deploy this ML algorithm with all the flags.
