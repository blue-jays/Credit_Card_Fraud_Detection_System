What are we looking for ? 
- After we have split the categorical and the numerical feature, we plot graphs.
- For numerical features
    - Plot histograms to check distribution
    - Look for outlier by outlier detection methods 
    - get correlation with the target variable. Spearmen or pearson correlation test.


- Compare a single feature, with all the other feature, and get some questions and answers.



- When we are getting the feature importance, make sure the data frame has (target) has both 0 and 1. Because
earlier when I was doing with the split target, only fraud, the feature importance, all of them was 0. SO make 
sure to include the whole data frame.

- dates make a mess when training, better to drop it out.
- When getting the feature importance, make sure we dont use high resulting dimension encoding technique,
Because, that is when the dimension increases. the features get split and the split feature cannot capture 
the true depth of the data set, cannot get the pattern. So avoid splitting the features.

- So even if the feature is nornmally distributeed, we do the scaling to make sire all of the features are on 
same scale
- Consider a dataset with two features, one representing age (0-100) and the other representing income (0-100,000).
Even if age is normally distributed, the income feature would dominate distance calculations
 due to its larger range if both features are not scaled
